Things Fixed:

The WireFrame folders
library-WireFrame and SampleApp-WireFrame folders were based on an older set of commits and hence were missing test, and referencing old code

Third attempt wrong error message (tests also updated):
--Realised that the user was being notified as lock out after 4th attempt instead of at third attempt, even though they were really locked out since the 3rd attempt
 but the wrong error message at 3rd attempt was being displayed. E.G. at 3rd attempt error was incorrect password instead of 'Account Locked for 20 minutes...'

\MHPAUTH\SampleApp
|> In the above directory  main.ts can also run using the following command ts-node .\main.ts [may have to use terminal in admin mode]
	|> this might be preferable/alternative option for running instead of using default nodemon
|> main.ts have been cleaned up to run two functions and variables were added to the top of file to make editing commands easier
|> npm start has been switcheed to run on test environment by default instead of dev environment, since the automated test data populates myhealthpasstest.user
